## Bubble Sort Steps
Suppose you have an unsorted array of elements...
1. Begin with the first two elements in the array.
2. If the element on the right is greater than the element on the left, swap the two elements. 
3. Now move one over to the second and third elements in the array, and repeat step 2.
4. Continue steps 2-3 until no more swaps are necessary.
